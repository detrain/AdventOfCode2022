# Notes

**Time: Program took 0.000230s.**

## Reflection
- Got to a working state, but code structure needs work (formatting/optimization/"generalizing")

- Need to build out a Utilties folder with useful macros / functions
    - Lists (Singly, Doubly)
    - Sorts (Bubble, Linear, etc...)
    - Searches (DFS, BFS)

## Revised
- The purpose of this was to go a bit harder in the paint, to dig deep for that data structure, algorithm knowledge I've been away from for awhile now. But, due to time and not over doing what is needed. I am going to shy away from that. Fully expecting I will need it later on in the harder challenges!
- Revamped code is now way simpler and just goes straight for the jugular.
- Also going to start timing all my solutions, why not!
